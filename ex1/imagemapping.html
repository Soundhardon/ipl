        <p> A chess piece, or chessman, is a game piece that is placed on a chessboard to play the game of chess. 
            It can be either white or black, and it can be one of six types: king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, or pawn.
            Each player begins with sixteen pieces.
            The pieces that belong to each player are distinguished by color: the lighter colored pieces are referred to as "white" and the player that owns them as "White", whereas the darker colored pieces are referred to as "black" and the player that owns them as "Black".
            In a standard game, each of the two players begins with the following sixteen pieces:
            <ul>
            <li>1 king</li>
            <li>1 queen</li>
            <li>2 rooks</li>
            <li>2 bishops</li>
            <li>2 knights</li>
            <li>8 pawns</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
